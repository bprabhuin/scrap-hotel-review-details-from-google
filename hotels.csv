Hotel Crystal Urban Park,4.6,"Good hotel. Great servive and nice rooms. But restaurant food & service needs lot of improvements

The Presidency,4.0,"Very Nice experience üòÉ...with a budget friendly price and pleasant stay ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

Its good. Nice ambience and good banquet halls. Good for marriages and family functions. Well behaved suportive staff.

The hotel is located on the main road and traffic noise may not be to everyone's liking. Rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious. Large part of the hotel is not accessible because of Covid restrictions. Food is average. Room service and restaurant service are very slow.

Good ambience and food .. A bit pricy .. so plan as per your budget..

I have visited Presidency to attain a Reception. Ambiance was OK but food was not up to the mark.You can reach here easily by choosing a wide range of transportation options as this is side of NH.ISKON Temple is adjacent to this place & One Mall is also present near by.

Very kind staff. Had a pleasant stay! 1 star less for room other than that.. everything is good

Nice Hotel,Location is really good,Very calm place and the entrance is really good.Rooms are clean,Bathrooms are clean but little bit cozy,Need improvement on Staffs,They were not giving me my room which I have paid for.

Presidency is a decent hang out for all age groups.  The view from the roof top restaurant is very beautiful. You can see the highway and vehicles passing.

Yesterday I was in bhubaneswar in - THE CROWN HOTEL and I want to convey you the message that go check that as soon as possible because you are going to love it's digital systematic rooms the card key lock system and a nice sofa with a foot placing sofa type stool and a study table. The lift was also very classy.

Nice hotel ,well equiped ,good staff behaviour ,no complaints even we booked a deluxe room and they gave us a family suit instead no charges were taken extra"
Ginger Bhubaneshwar,3.8,"Rooms were good. Nice and clean. A bit costly though. But compared to other hotels nearby, it was good. I enjoyed it. FYI it's a non smoking hotel. And that's a good thing

This hotel is in a prime location, on NH. Exactly opposite to NALCO headquarters. The food is good. They need to improve little bit on service speed. Staffs are good. Only one big disadvantage is that in parking space, they don't take ownership for any of the guest cars being parked inside. There is sticker which clearly states ""parking at owner's risk"". There is no data management of parked vehicles. They really need to work on this as it increases the risk of car owner as well as hotel.Otherwise hotel is good, stay is good and food is also good.

It's a nice, clean hotel. Just at Jaydev Vihar. Situated on Main Street. Rooms are very compact. Double Room suits for a single person.overall comfortable stay.

Excellent place for the purpose of halting and staying, but not for luxury stays. Rooms are Clean and service is excellent! Food was served hot and fresh each and every time. The beds were too soft for my liking and may give back and neck pains to some people but for a night stay for taking rest while travelling, it's good enough. All in all its worth the money and a fantastic experience.

Perfect hotel for family and business trip.Don't forget that ginger hotel is backed by TATA GROUP. So be assured of hygiene and loyalty.Staff and Service is just like 5 star hotel. Clean place with hygiene and good food. ‚Ä¶

The checkin and ambience was smooth, ample parking available, rooms were pre arranged and clean. Food was good,a lil expensive though. Room could be bigger, and staff quarter should be added. But rest it was a very satisfactory stayRooms neat and clean, ambience. Staffs were friendy

Excellent stay. Too good location. Breakfast was too good and fresh. In house safety and security is very good. Full functional gym is an added advantage. In house ambience is awesome. Staff are very cordial and  helpful. ‚Ä¶

Rooms are good. Staff is cooperative. Food is average. Remember, this is a budget hotel.Clear Fire Escape routes and fire hydrants are lacking.

Good place to stay for Business. Restaurants service to be improved. Spacious room and good car parking

The hotel is no doubtly good for location, staff and quality stay. The service is superb without any questions. Best hotel in Bhubaneswar.The quality of food is very good. They maintained hygiene everywhere."

I was here for the third time, nevertheless I experienced the same friendly staff, excellent local food, natural ambience. If you don't want to get disturb by the hustle of city yet want to reach your destination with minimum time this is the place to stay. The staff goes out of their way to help you out. The front desk too comprises of very friendly people. The stark cleanliness and hygiene maintained by the hotel us remarkable too. I highly recommend this hotel.

The hotel is good for stay, staff is friendly the only problem I found was that the tea/coffee maker was not working and AC remote was not working but they replaced it once I told them so overall a good experience

The Hotel has a great interior and has a beautiful lobby garden. The room was well furnished and the bathrooms were clean and hygienic. The breakfast was ok. Though a lot of things on the menu was not provided like Indian breads(Paratha, Naan, etc), Roti was provided.

Spacious banquet hall, very convenient for family get together and functions. Social distancing is very well taken care of. Overall, well recommended!

The hotel is located near Mancheswar Industrial Area. It is a costly hotel with all types of rooms including suite. It has it's own restaurant that offers only Indian cuisine and has a bar with room service for both. Hotel is couple friendly too. It has lifts. Room cleaning is only offered if your stay is minimum 3 days, with a complimentary breakfast. It follows 24 hours check-in and check-out process. It doesn't have swimming pool. It has free WIFI service. Food quality is not that good as per the hotel standards. Mostly recommended for urgent/ official visits. Food is very costly also.

Hotel is really good to stay, room was cleaned. 1st floor generally for family non smoking, 2nd floor is for smoking. Outside garden is very well maintained since its at the end of the road so entire road is fully green. So you will love to roam around hotel building. Food was also good in restaurant. There was jammu cricket team staying in same hotel so you can think of the hotel standard. It is located at main highway so you can plan to go outskirts very easily, no need to go inside city. Easily reachable from city, nandan kanan zoo, udyangiri caves, etc.

property is good.... isolated place, though it is nearer to the city but feels far away from bbsr..... greenery and maintenance is good... service is very poor...of course due to covid, but they tood undue advantage of the Covid not ‚Ä¶"
